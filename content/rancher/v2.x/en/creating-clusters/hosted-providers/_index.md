If you already have a cluster hosted by a Kubernetes provider, Rancher can integrate with its cloud APIs, allowing you to manage your hosted cluster from the Rancher UI.

Rancher supports the following Kubernetes providers:

- [Google GKE (Google Container Engine)](#google-gke-google-container-engine)
- [Amazon EKS (Elastic Container Service)](#amazon-eks-elastic-container-service)
- [Microsoft AKS (Azure Container Service)](#microsoft-aks-azure-container-service)

<!-- /TOC -->

When setting up management of your hosted Kubernetes cluster in the Rancher UI, you are prompted for parameters required in all cluster creation scenarios: cluster name, user membership, how many nodes to create, and so on. However, each provider also requires information unique to the vendor. See more information about the information required for each provider below.
