To record cluster or project events, Rancher can integrate with a variety of popular logging services that exist outside of your clusters. Configuring logging services:

- Alerts you to errors and warnings in your Kubernetes infrastructure in a live stream.
- Allows you to view data reports using your logging service's tools and identify trends in your clusters or projects.
