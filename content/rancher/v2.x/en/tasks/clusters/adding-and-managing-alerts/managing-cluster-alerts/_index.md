After an alert is created, the alert might need to change. Each alert can be modified for what it is alerting, deactivated/activated to turn off/on the alert, or deleted from Rancher.

1. Navigate to the cluster that you want to add alerts to, by finding the cluster name in the main dropdown menu.

2. In the cluster, under **Tools**, select **Alerts**.

3. Find the alert that you want to modify and click on the **vertical ellipsis**.

4. Select the option that you want to use:

  * **Edit:** Modify the alert. Any of the parameters of the alert can be modified.
  * **Deactivate:** Mute the alert. The alert parameters are saved but you will no longer be notified until the alert is activated again.
  * **Delete:** Delete the alert. If the alert is no longer necessary, remove it.

If there are many alerts that need to be modified, there are bulk actions available to manage the alerts.
